## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Abdelrahman Hassan — a full-time **banker** and a self-taught **programmer** who enjoys solving real-world problems with code.

I build desktop and web tools using **.NET**, **C#**, and **WPF**. Whether it’s automating financial workflows or creating custom tools for productivity, I love designing useful, user-friendly apps.

### 💡 What drives me  
I love understanding how systems work and making them better. That curiosity is what pushes me to keep learning and building.
